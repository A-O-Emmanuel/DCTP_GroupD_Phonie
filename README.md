### Problem Statement

01 - Phonie: Identify the telecoms carrier from a phone number

### Scenario

A user is filling a form in your web application and they are required to enter their phone number into a form field.

### Outcome

After typing the phone number into the form field, the UI indicates that it is an MTN or GLO or Airtel or 9mobile number e.t.c (e.g if its an MTN line, display the MTN icon/logo somewhere beside the form field)

### Steps on how to contibute

- Ensure you have git installed on your manchine. Run the following command to check if you have git installed by opening a command prompt;

  <code>git -v</code>

- If the command throw an error, then check this [link](https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/install-git/) to install git for your machine.

- Next, fork this repo

  Click the fork button at the top right of this repo. This will make a copy of this repo to your github account

- Clone the repo to your local machine to be able to contribute your code: 1. open a terminal or right click on your desktop and click git bash here which will open the gitbash terminal on your machine

  <code>git clone https://github.com/your_username/DCTP_GroupD_Phonie.git</code>

        Note: Ensure your username is included in the link or better still on you can copy the link directly from your forked repo by clicking the green code button which will display the link to the repo.

  <code>cd DCTP_GroupD_Phonie</code> changes your working directory to the repo folder

- create a branch to work in with your slack username - for example I want to create a branch for myself to contribute - I'll run :

  <code>git checkout -b kooljoe</code> - This will checkout to my branch call kooljoe with all existing files in the main branch copied into the new branch

- Implement your contribution

- Add your name and email to the authors file by editing the file

- After you're done, git add and git commit your changes with meaningful commit message by running:

  <code>git add .</code> stage all changes for commit
  <code>git commit -m "Your commit message"</code>

- push your changes to your own branch and not the main branch. Please this is very important - E.g. Assuming am done adding my own feature or contribution to the project, after adding my commit, i'll push my code to my branch by running:

- <code>git push origin kooljoe</code> - this will push my commit changes to my remote branch

- make a pull request by going to your forked repo on github, refresh the page and you should see a prompt asking you to make a pull request. follow the prompt, then your changes will be merged to the main branch once it meets the functionality its expected to meet.

##### Good Luck
